AUDIO_SYSTEM_MPAL	2
Output: None

Function: AiUpdate
Purpose: This function is called to allow the DLL to update
things on a regular basis (check how long to sound to
go, copy more stuff to the buffer, anything you like).
The function is designed to go in to the message loop
of the main window...but can be placed anywhere you
like.
Input: If wait is set to true, then this function should wait
till there is a message in its message queue.
Output: None

FALSE on failure to initialize
Note on interrupts:
To generate an interrupt set the appropriate bit in MI_INTR_REG
and then call the function CheckInterrupts to tell the emulator
that there is a waiting interrupt.
